He’s probably the\\nlast person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see in\\nany sort of self-help book.\\nWhich is why he’s the perfect place to start.\\nBukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected\\nby almost every magazine, newspaper, journal, agent, and publisher he\\nsubmitted to. His work was horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved.\\nAnd as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed\\nhim deep into an alcohol-fueled depression that would follow him for most of\\nhis life.\\nBukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit\\nmoney and spent most of it on booze. He \\ngambled away the rest at the\\nracetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry\\non his beat-up old typewriter. Often, he’d wake up on the floor, having\\npassed out the night before.\\nThirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol,\\ndrugs, gambling, and prostitutes. Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a\\nlifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a small independent\\npublishing house took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn’t offer\\nBukowski much money or much promise of sales. But he had a weird\\naffection for the drunk loser, so he decided to take a chance on him. It was\\nthe first real shot Bukowski had ever gotten, and, he realized, probably the\\nonly one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: “I have one\\nof two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy . . . or stay out here and\\nplay at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.”'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Upon signing the contract, Bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks.\\nIt was called simply \\nPost Office.\\n In the dedication, he wrote, “Dedicated to\\nnobody.”\\nBukowski would make it as a novelist and poet. He would go on and\\npublish six novels and hundreds of poems, selling over two million copies of\\nhis books. His popularity defied everyone’s expectations, particularly his\\nown.\\nStories like Bukowski’s are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative.\\nBukowski’s life embodies the American Dream: a man fights for what he\\nwants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It’s\\npractically a movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like Bukowski’s\\nand \\nsay, “See? He never gave up. He never stopped trying. He always\\nbelieved in himself. He persisted against all the odds and made something of\\nhimself!”\\nIt is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t\\ntry.”\\nSee, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew\\nit. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but\\nfrom the fact that he \\nknew\\n he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly\\nabout it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in\\nBukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing\\nhimself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple\\nability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the\\nworst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.\\nThis is the real story of Bukowski’s success: his comfort with himself as a\\nfailure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about success. Even after his fame, he\\nstill showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in\\nhis audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with every\\nwoman he could find. Fame and success didn’t make him a better person. Nor\\nwas it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful.\\nSelf-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t\\nnecessarily mean they’re the same thing.\\nOur culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive\\nexpectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be\\nsmarter, faster, richer, sexier, \\nmore popular, more productive, more envied,\\nand more admired.

We\\nhave so much fucking stuff and so many \\nopportunities that we don’t even\\nknow what to give a fuck about anymore.\\nBecause there’s an infinite amount of things we can now see or know,\\nthere are also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we don’t\\nmeasure up, that we’re not good enough, that things aren’t as great as they\\ncould be. And this rips us apart inside.\\nBecause here’s the thing that’s wrong with all of the “How to Be Happy”\\nshit that’s been shared eight million times on Facebook in the past few years\\n—here’s what nobody realizes about all of this crap:\\nThe desire for more positive experience is itself a negative\\nexperience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s\\nnegative experience is itself a positive experience.\\nThis is a total mind-fuck. So I’ll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain\\nand maybe read that again: \\nWanting positive experience is a negative\\nexperience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. \\nIt’s what\\nthe philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law”—the idea\\nthat the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you\\nbecome, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the\\nfirst place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and\\nunworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. The\\nmore you desperately want to be sexy \\nand desired, the uglier you come to see\\nyourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you\\ndesperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you\\nbecome, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be\\nspiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in\\ntrying to get there.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='should help clarify the matter.\\nSubtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it\\nmeans being comfortable with being different.\\nLet’s be clear. There’s absolutely nothing admirable or confident about\\nindifference. People who are indifferent are \\nlame and scared. They’re couch\\npotatoes and Internet trolls. In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be\\nindifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck\\nabout what everyone thinks of their hair, so they never bother washing or\\ncombing it. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas, so\\nthey hide behind sarcasm and self-righteous snark. They’re afraid to let\\nanyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique\\nsnowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever understand.\\nIndifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their\\nown choices. That’s why they don’t make any meaningful choices. They hide\\nin a gray, emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitying,\\nperpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding\\ntheir time and energy called life.\\nBecause here’s a sneaky truth about life. There’s no such thing as not\\ngiving a fuck. \\nYou must give a fuck about something.\\n It’s part of our biology\\nto always care about something and therefore to always give a fuck.\\nThe question, then, is, \\nWhat \\ndo we give a fuck about? What are we\\nchoosing\\n to give a fuck about? And how can we not give a fuck about what\\nultimately does not matter?\\nMy mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a\\nclose friend of hers. Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my\\nshoulders, sipped my mocha, and downloaded another season of \\nThe Wire.\\nSorry, Mom.\\nBut instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, “No, screw that,\\nMom. We’re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why?\\nBecause I don’t give a fuck. I will ruin this guy’s life if I have to.”\\nThis illustrates the first subtlety of not giving a fuck. When we say,\\n“Damn, watch out, Mark Manson just don’t give a fuck,” we don’t mean that\\nMark Manson doesn’t care about \\nanything;\\n on the contrary, we mean that\\nMark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t\\ncare about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or'),\n",

He\\njust doesn’t give a fuck.\\nThis is what is so admirable. No, not me, dumbass—the overcoming\\nadversity stuff, the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the\\nsake of one’s own values. The willingness to stare failure in the face and\\nshove your middle finger back at it. The people who don’t give a fuck about\\nadversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few\\ntimes. The people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway.\\nBecause they know it’s right. They know it’s more important than they are,\\nmore important than their own feelings and their own pride and their own\\nego. They say, “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything\\nunimportant\\n in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends.\\nFamily. Purpose. Burritos. And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of\\nthat, because they reserve their fucks for only \\nthe big things that matter,\\npeople give a fuck about them in return.\\nBecause here’s another sneaky little truth about life. You can’t be an\\nimportant and life-changing presence for some people without also being a\\njoke and an embarrassment to others. You just can’t. Because there’s no such\\nthing as a lack of adversity. It doesn’t exist. The old saying goes that no\\nmatter where you go, there you are. Well, the same is true for adversity and\\nfailure. No matter where you go, there’s a five-hundred-pound load of shit\\nwaiting for you. And that’s perfectly fine. The point isn’t to get away from\\nthe shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with.\\nSubtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a\\nfuck about something more important than adversity.\\nImagine you’re at a grocery store, and you watch an elderly lady scream\\nat the cashier, berating him for not accepting her thirty-cent coupon.

It is\\nnature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live\\nwith a certain degree \\nof dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly\\ndissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to\\ninnovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we\\nhave and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction\\nhas kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no—\\nour own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature.\\nPain, in all of its forms, is our body’s most effective means of spurring\\naction. Take something as simple as stubbing your toe. If you’re like me,\\nwhen you stub your toe you scream enough four-letter words to make Pope\\nFrancis cry. You also probably blame some poor inanimate object for your\\nsuffering. “Stupid table,” you say. Or maybe you even go so far as to\\nquestion your entire interior design philosophy based on your throbbing foot:\\n“What kind of idiot puts a table there anyway? Seriously?”\\nBut I digress. That horrible stubbed-toe-induced pain, the one you and I\\nand the pope hate so much, exists for an important reason. Physical pain is a\\nproduct of our nervous system, a feedback mechanism to give us a sense of\\nour own physical proportions—where we can and cannot move and what we\\ncan and cannot touch. When we exceed those limits, our nervous system duly\\npunishes us to make sure that we pay attention and never do it again.\\nAnd this pain, as much as we hate it, \\nis\\n useful. Pain is what teaches us\\nwhat to pay attention to when we’re young or careless. It helps show us\\nwhat’s good for us versus what’s bad for us. It helps us understand and\\nadhere to our own \\nlimitations. It teaches us to not fuck around near hot stoves\\nor stick metal objects into electrical sockets. Therefore, it’s not always\\nbeneficial to avoid pain and seek pleasure, since pain can, at times, be life-or-\\ndeath important to our well-being.\\nBut pain is not merely physical.

The next is failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and\\nmistakes so that they may be improved upon. The fourth is rejection: the\\nability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will\\nnot accept in your life.

He would have been overcome by anxiety or self-doubt. He likely\\nwouldn’t have improved and innovated his craft in the ways he did decade\\nafter decade.\\nThe reason for Picasso’s success is exactly the same reason why, as an\\nold man, he was happy to scribble drawings on a napkin alone in a café.

This was Poland, so things had been pretty gruesome. These people\\nhad experienced or witnessed mass starvation, bombings that turned cities to\\nrubble, the Holocaust, the torture of prisoners of war, and the rape and/or\\nmurder of family members, if not by the Nazis, then a few years later by the\\nSoviets.\\nAs Dabrowski studied the survivors, he noticed something both surprising\\nand amazing. A sizable percentage of them believed that the wartime\\nexperiences they’d suffered, although painful and indeed traumatic, had\\nactually caused them to become better, more responsible, and yes, even\\nhappier people. Many described their lives before the war as if they’d been\\ndifferent people then: ungrateful for and unappreciative of their loved ones,\\nlazy and consumed by petty problems, entitled to all they’d been given. After\\nthe war they felt more confident, more sure of themselves, more grateful, and\\nunfazed by life’s trivialities and petty annoyances.\\nObviously, their experiences had been horrific, and these survivors\\nweren’t happy about having had to experience them. Many of them still\\nsuffered from the emotional scars the lashings of war had left on them. But\\nsome of them had \\nmanaged to leverage those scars to transform themselves in\\npositive and powerful ways.\\nAnd they aren’t alone in that reversal. For many of us, our proudest\\nachievements come in the face of the greatest adversity. Our pain often\\nmakes us stronger, more resilient, more grounded. Many cancer survivors, for\\nexample, report feeling stronger and more grateful after winning their battle\\nto survive. Many military personnel report a mental resilience gained from\\nwithstanding the dangerous environments of being in a war zone.\\nDabrowski argued that fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily\\nalways undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, they are often\\nrepresentative of the necessary pain of psychological growth. And to deny\\nthat pain is to deny our own potential.

They saw the\\npractice as an unscientific form of oppression against the weak and helpless.\\nThe problem was that Becker’s boss was a psychiatrist. So it was kind of\\nlike walking into your first job and proudly comparing your boss to Hitler.\\nAs you can imagine, he was fired.\\nSo Becker took his radical ideas somewhere that they \\nmight be accepted:\\nBerkeley, California.

Humans are unique in that we’re the only animals that can conceptualize\\nand think about ourselves abstractly. Dogs don’t sit around and worry\\nabout their career. Cats don’t think about their past mistakes or wonder\\nwhat would have happened if they’d done something differently.\\nMonkeys don’t argue over future possibilities, just as fish don’t sit around\\nwondering if other fish would like them more if they had longer fins.\\nAs humans, we’re blessed with the ability to imagine ourselves in\\nhypothetical situations, to contemplate both the past and the future, to\\nimagine other realities or situations where things might be different. And\\nit’s because of this unique mental ability, Becker says, that we all, at\\nsome point, become aware of the inevitability of our own death. Because\\nwe’re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the\\nonly animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content='This realization causes what Becker calls “death terror,” a deep\\nexistential anxiety that underlies \\neverything \\nwe think or do.\\n2.   Becker’s second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two\\n“selves.” The first self is the physical self—the one that eats, sleeps,\\nsnores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self—our identity, or\\nhow we see ourselves.\\nBecker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some \\nlevel that our\\nphysical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its\\ninevitability—on some unconscious level—scares the shit out of us.\\nTherefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our\\nphysical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever.\\nThis is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues,\\non spines of books. It’s why we feel compelled to spend so much time\\ngiving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our\\ninfluence—our conceptual self—will last way beyond our physical self.\\nThat we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our\\nphysical self ceases to exist.\\nBecker called such efforts our “immortality projects,” projects that\\nallow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical\\ndeath. All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of\\nimmortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and\\nauthorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and\\nwomen who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves\\nthat ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and\\nShakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not\\nmore so. And that’s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an\\nart form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a\\nlarge and loving family that will live on for generations, \\nall the meaning\\nin our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die.\\nReligion, politics, sports, art, and technological innovation are the result\\nof people’s immortality projects. Becker argues that wars and revolutions and\\nmass murder occur when one group of people’s immortality projects rub up\\nagainst another group’s. Centuries of oppression and the bloodshed of\\nmillions have been justified as the defense of one group’s immortality project\\nagainst another’s.'),\n",

As can, as Becker points out, mental illness.\\nIf you haven’t figured it out yet, our immortality projects are our values.\\nThey are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life. And when our\\nvalues fail, so do we, psychologically speaking. What Becker is saying, in\\nessence, is that we’re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about\\nsomething, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that\\ndistracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death. And to truly\\nnot give a single fuck is to achieve a quasi-spiritual state of embracing the\\nimpermanence of one’s own existence. In that state, one is far less likely to\\nget caught up in various forms of entitlement.\\nBecker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that people’s\\nimmortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution; that rather\\nthan attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self\\nacross the world, people should question their conceptual \\nself and become\\nmore comfortable with the reality of their own death. Becker called this “the\\nbitter antidote,” and struggled with reconciling it himself as he stared down\\nhis own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable. Therefore, we should not\\navoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can.\\nBecause once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the\\nroot terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions\\n—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical\\nquest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.\\nThe Sunny Side of Death\\nI step from rock to rock, climbing steadily, leg muscles stretching and aching.\\nIn that trancelike state that comes from slow, repetitive physical exertion, I’m\\nnearing the top.

He’s probably the\\nlast person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see in\\nany sort of self-help book.\\nWhich is why he’s the perfect place to start.\\nBukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected\\nby almost every magazine, newspaper, journal, agent, and publisher he\\nsubmitted to. His work was horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved.\\nAnd as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed\\nhim deep into an alcohol-fueled depression that would follow him for most of\\nhis life.\\nBukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit\\nmoney and spent most of it on booze. He \\ngambled away the rest at the\\nracetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry'),\n",

Often, he’d wake up on the floor, having\\npassed out the night before.\\nThirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol,\\ndrugs, gambling, and prostitutes. Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a\\nlifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a small independent\\npublishing house took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn’t offer\\nBukowski much money or much promise of sales. But he had a weird\\naffection for the drunk loser, so he decided to take a chance on him. It was\\nthe first real shot Bukowski had ever gotten, and, he realized, probably the\\nonly one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: “I have one\\nof two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy . . . or stay out here and\\nplay at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.”'),\n",

He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in\\nBukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing\\nhimself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple\\nability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the\\nworst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.\\nThis is the real story of Bukowski’s success: his comfort with himself as a\\nfailure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about success. Even after his fame, he\\nstill showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in\\nhis audience.
